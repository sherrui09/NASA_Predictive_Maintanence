NASA Turbofan Engine Failure Prediction using LSTMs
***********************************************

Introduction
------------
This repository contains the Python code for building and evaluating Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict turbofan engine failure from sensor data. The project is structured into three main files that preprocess the data, construct a binary classification LSTM model, and construct a multi-class LSTM model.

File Descriptions
-----------------
1. lstm_data_processing.py: 
   - Description: This script contains all the preprocessing steps required for both the binary and multi-class LSTM models.
   - Note: It must be run first to prepare the data.

2. nasalstmbinary.py: 
   - Description: This Python file contains the code for creating, training, and evaluating the binary classification LSTM model.

3. nasalstmmulti-class.py: 
   - Description: This Python file contains the code for creating, training, and evaluating the multi-class LSTM model.
