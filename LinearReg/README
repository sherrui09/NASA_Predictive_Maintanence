NASA Turbofan Engine Failure Prediction using Linear Regression
***********************************************

Introduction
------------
This repository contains the Python code for building and evaluating a Linear Regression model to predict turbofan engine failure from sensor data.

Code Description
-----------------
After cleaning the data, each feature is normalized. Two linear models are the built, the first using all the features, and the second using Lasso regularization for variable selection.
Both models are run on the training data at first, then extrapolated to the test data.
